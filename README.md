# HTMACat

# 1. Introduction

A high-throughput modeling, calculation, and analysis framework for catalytic reaction processes, it provides key tools
for high-throughput design and screening of catalytic materials. The software mainly includes functional modules such as
surface structure analysis and information extraction, catalytic surface and various adsorption model construction,
automatic construction of primitive reaction processes, automatic extraction of computational data and automatic
extraction and construction of descriptors.The software can perform the following computational workflows: adsorption
energy calculation and analysis workflow, primitive reaction calculation and analysis workflow, high throughput
calculation and automated analysis of adsorption energy and reaction potential of catalytic primitive reaction
processes, etc.

# 3. Getting started

## 3.1 High-throughput adsorption modeling

### 1) Prepare the input files

`config.yaml` should be prepared in your working folder.
`Config.yaml` file Contains two parts: 
- `StuctInfo` parts 
- `Model` parts

The format of the whole `config.yaml` is as follows:
   ```yaml
   StrucInfo:
    element: Au
    lattype: fcc
    latcont: 4.16
    facet: ['111','100']
    dope:
      Cu: [3]
   
   Model:
    SML: False
    ads:
      - ['NH3',1]
      - ['NO', 2]
    coads: 
      - ['NH3','O',1,1]
   ```

`StuctInfo` parts contains the information about substrate, including:

- `element`: bulk phase element
- `lattype`: lattice type
- `latcont`: lattice parameter
- `facet`: crystal plane, hould be a *list*, start with `[`, separate with `,` and end with `]`, facet index
  should
  be a str start with `'` end with `'`, like `'100'`,`'111'`
- `dope`: dope of the substrate, the formate is `dope element : [dope type1, dope type2]`
  before `:` is the doped element, after the `:` is the dope type, the dope type can be chosen as follows：
  `0` corresponds to no doping, `1`, `2` and `3`correspond to surface layers doped with `1`, `2` and `3` atoms,
  respectively.
  `1L` and `b1` represent surface layer substitution and bulk equivalent proportional substitution.

`Model` parts contains the adsorption modeling parameters, including:

- `SML`: whether using *Smiles* toe represent the adsorption species
- `ads`: using `- [ adsorbate formular , adsorption sites type]` to represent one adsorption status, where
  adsorption formular should be a str start with `'` end with `'`. Different adsorption status should start with
  new line, adsorption sites type can be chosen from `1` or `2`.
- `coads`: using `- [ads1, ads2, ads1 sites, ads2 sites]`, *ads1* and *ads2* is two adsorbate species formular,
  *ads1 sites* and *ads2 sites* is adsorption sites type, can be chosen from `1` and `2`.

**To avoid ambiguity, it is recommended that SMILES be used when declaring complex species.** Users can modify the
corresponding parameters to achieve customized modeling according to their research needs.

### 2) run script

Running command `htmat ads` can automate the enumeration and construction of all possible configurations, and ultimately
output structure files in the VASP format, like Au_Cu_111_1_NH_0.vasp, 
Furthermore, for the adsorption models on doped surfaces, we use the `get_binding_adatom` function to determine the
types of surface atoms that the adsorbate binds to in the preliminary configurations. We only select configurations
where the adsorbate is bound to a surface atom that contains a dopant atom, in order to reduce the number of final
output structures.
